# Courtyard Simulation

A simulation based off of a thought experiment, conceived one day during lunch in Junior Year of High School.

As of this commit, the framework is built out (minimally). What's left is to determine probabilities to
support a pseudo-randomized decisionmaking process.

## To Do:

1. Work out probabilities so that the `SimulationEngine` actually simulates.
